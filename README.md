# C implemented cli math tools - **Quick, easily accessed, accurate, and extensible**

### GOALS
- **The production of an extensible set of CLI math utilities ranging from the most basic to the most advance mathmatical calculations**
- These may or may not be eventually aggregated into one program (There are access-time, and ease-of-use advantages to keeping them all separate)

Note: Unless you're not aware you need to compile these programs yourself with GCC before you use them
for example $~ gcc average.c -o average

MATH PROGRAMS - The purpose of these programs is to slowly and incrementally create the building blocks of a master calculator capable of doing all types of mathematics including but not limited to, real analysis, statistical analysis, trigonometry, calculus, geometry, linear algebra, ETC... These individual programs can be thought of as the constituent working parts of my personal project to build a sophisticated Calculator written in the C language. 

- average.c - takes an indefinite amount of command line integer arguments and averages them printing to stdout
- stdev.c - calculates standard deviation and variance from float arguments (sample population), and prints them to stdout.
