# Personal-C-Programs

This is a repo where I will store personal C programs that I've written. Below are a list of the current program types. 
New program types are only to be added after at least one program in that type has been completed.


MATH PROGRAMS - The purpose of these programs is to slowly and incrementally create the building blocks of a master calculator capable of doing all types of mathematics including but not limited to, real analysis, statistical analysis, trigonometry, calculus, geometry, linear algebra, ETC... These individual programs can be thought of as the constituent working parts of my personal project to build a sophisticated Calculator written in the C language.

1. Statistics:

STDDeviationCalculator.c - Calculates sample standard deviation from sample population


2. Geometrical

CircleMathCalc.c - Calculates Diameter, Circumference, and Area from user-supplied radius
